# Google Foobar Challenge Experience

Hey Everyone! I wanted to share that I participated in the Google 2024 Foobar challenge and successfully completed all 4 levels! (Still 1a to go ðŸ”¥). I'll be sharing all the code snippets, notes, and challenges on my GitHub account and my LinkedIn feed soon! [Check it out here](https://lnkd.in/dJnZ6NQ8).



## What is Foobar Challenge?

Google Foobar is Google's secret hiring challenge, used to recruit some of the best developers globally. Once you accept the invite, you'll be taken to a website where you're given a question and a time limit to solve it. If successful, you move on to higher levels; failure results in being unable to request new problems. You'll receive questions to solve in either Java or Python, with a total of 5 levels and 9 questions.

## My Experience with the Google FooBar Challenge

Access to the Google Foobar page is not public, and receiving an invitation is mysterious. Google sends invitations based on your search history and problem-solving-related keyword searches. The invitation message reads: "Curious developers are known to seek interesting problems. Solve one from Google?"

## More about the Questions

The challenge had 5 levels, each containing questions related to graphs and maths. With the submission of this question, the Google Foobar Challenge is completed!


## More about the Questions

The challenge had 5 levels, with each level featuring questions related to graphs and mathematics.

### Level 1
The first level resembled a typical interview question and provided a 2-day time frame for completion. I found it relatively straightforward and completed it quickly.

### Level 2
At this level, there were two questions, each with a 72-hour time limit. Both questions were based on principles of linear algebra and mathematics.

### Level 3
Level 3 consisted of 3 questions, with 4 days given for the first question and 7 days for the remaining two. Solving these questions required a solid understanding of mathematics and programming concepts such as dynamic programming and Markovâ€™s chaining. After completing Level 3, I was asked to provide my details for contact by a Google recruiter, including basic information like name, phone number, email address, and country.

### Level 4
There were two questions at Level 4, each with a total of 15 days to solve. This level demanded the implementation of various concepts to solve a single problem. Extensive knowledge of algorithms and data structures was necessary, with questions revolving around number theory and graphs.

### Level 5
The final level featured a single question with a 22-day time limit. Remarkably, I managed to solve it in just 22 hours. This level was purely mathematical, involving permutations, Beatty sequences, and the development of an implementation with exponentially decreasing complexity.

With the submission of the final question, I successfully completed the Google Foobar Challenge!

Additionally, I'm excited to announce that I'll be hosting a 3-day bootcamp following the first session of the AI Roadmap, which I previously shared on my IG and LinkedIn. Unfortunately, the spots for this project are full at the moment, but I plan to organize another bootcamp soon for those who missed out. Stay tuned for updates on this, as well as a small 24-hour challenge similar to Google Foobar TN, to prepare participants for next year's challenge. The goal of these projects is to unite Tunisian talent in the realm of AI.

By the way, this year I have 5 referrals to Google Summer 2024 Internships, and the top 5 performers in the GoogleTN Foobar challenge will receive my referrals as prizes.

This concludes the additional information about the Google Foobar Challenge and upcoming projects.

# PS: Two years ago, I was an Artificial Intelligence Engineer Intern with Google London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, and this year I was accepted for a 2024 XAI Research apprenticeship with Google India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³. Check my LinkedIn Profile to know more about these and to see some highlighted internship projects.

I highly recommend participating in the Foobar challenge as it's a great opportunity to learn. While solving the problems, focus on learning new techniques and experiencing one of the best coding challenges. Remember, Foobar is more about learning and implementing than knowing everything beforehand!
